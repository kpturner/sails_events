I found that my server was sending uot a load of spam as "root".  I have not found out what was sending
it yet, but I was able to block it at least in the SMTP server config.  My SMTP server is postfix
so I edited /etc/postfix/main.cf and added this line:

authorized_submit_users = !root, static:anyone

To purge messages in the root mailbox I ran
> /var/spool/mail/root
(remember the >)

To delete all deferred messages in the queue I used
postuser -d ALL deferred
