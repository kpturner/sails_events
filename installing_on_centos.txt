Log in to CENTOS (Plesk on Parallels) using putty.exe 
Log in as "root"
Run the following commands to install node.js and npm

====================================================================================
Install c++ compiler (note this is liable to change as node release move on and require newer compilers):

cd
sudo curl http://linuxsoft.cern.ch/cern/scl/slc6-scl.repo > /etc/yum.repos.d/slc6-scl.repo
sudo rpm --import http://ftp.mirrorservice.org/sites/ftp.scientificlinux.org/linux/scientific/51/i386/RPM-GPG-KEYs/RPM-GPG-KEY-cern
sudo yum install -y devtoolset-3
scl enable devtoolset-3 bash

====================================================================================
Now create node (at the time of writing there is no nice install for node on centos so we have to build it):

echo 'export PATH=$HOME/local/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
. ~/.bashrc
mkdir ~/local
mkdir ~/node-latest-install
cd ~/node-latest-install
curl http://nodejs.org/dist/node-latest.tar.gz | tar xz --strip-components=1
./configure --prefix=$HOME/local
make install

WARNING:  The above takes AGES!

====================================================================================
Now install npm:
cd
curl -L https://www.npmjs.org/install.sh | sh

====================================================================================
Now for the node stuff we want:

Install forever:  "npm install forever -g"

Install sails:    "npm install sails -g"

Now install Git: "sudo yum install git"

get the nano editor: "yum install nano"

INSTALLS NOW COMPLETE

First time in
=============
Make a new folder structure in /usr:   /sails/projects 

Clone the repo from github:
git clone https://github.com/kpturner/sails_events.git /usr/sails/projects/events

cd /usr/sails/projects/events 

mkdir logs

Install missing modules:  "npm install"

Look in "events-service" file for instructions on installing a service to run this application.

In Plesk, create the squareevents.org domain and add a MySql database and user - usually called 
"squareevents" but double check the localhostMySqlServer settings in /usr/sails/projects/events/config/connections.js

In the squareevents.org file system replace the default index.html file with one that redirects 
to our node app.  There is an example in our root called "index.example".

run "sails lift" to fire everything up for the first time - this will also set up the database. 


Not first time in
=================
cd /usr/sails/projects/events 

Pull updates from GitHub using: "bash gitupdate.sh"

Stop the service:  "service events-service stop"
If DB updates required:   "sails lift"     (after lift completes, cancel then "service events-service start")
otherwise start service: "service events-service start"
