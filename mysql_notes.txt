I am documenting this in the hope that I will find it the next time this happens.

Every time I migrate to a new VPS and start Square Events (or SquareAdmin) I find that I cannot log in - and there are few clues as to why. The app just returns to the homepage.

It turns out that this is because the app cannot communicate with the MySQL database. Why?

On the new VPS the config file is usually in cat  /etc/mysql/my.cnf

There you can see that "bind-address = 127.0.0.1"

It should be "bind-address = *"

Modify this, save and restart MySql and all should be well  "systemctl  restart  mariadb"  (qassuming you are logged in as "root" otherwise use "sudo")
