I temporarily setup automysqlbackup by logging in using Putty.

From the default /usr direcory I cloned the git repo:
git clone https://github.com/rcruz/AutoMySQLBackup.git automysqlbackup

Then:
cd automysqlbackup
bash install.sh
 
During the install set the config location to " /etc/automysqlbackup" and the executable location to 
"/usr/local/bin"

Now going to proceed to follow the next link to configure and test:
